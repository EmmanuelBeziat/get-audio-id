# ðŸ”‰ get-audio-id
JS tool to parse music streaming services url (Spotify, Deezer, Youtube, â€¦) to get a song ID.

> *Important Note:* This work is a fork-ish of [get-video-id](https://github.com/radiovisual/get-video-id) from [@radiovisual](https://github.com/radiovisual), but meant to use audio services (Spotify, Deezer, etc.). Credits for the work should go to him.

# Purpose

This module will extract the Spotify, Deezer, including embed strings.

> Wait, why would I want to do that?

Thatâ€™s a good question, thanks for asking.

Letâ€™s say you want your users to easily share their favorites songs. You can either share them a long list of tutorials to correctly embed players from multiple services, and hope that they donâ€™t mess up (they will). Or, you can just as them for any kind of url/share protocol from any service, and then just treat the data to render the correct player with the desired song.

Thatâ€™s what this little tool is used for.

# Install

```bash
$ npm install --save get-audio-id
```

# Usage

Just call the class with a spotify/deezer url (or embed string) as a parameter. Its metadata (id and service) will be extracted.

```javascript
import GetAudioId from 'get-audio-id'

const audio = new GetAudioId('spotify:track:5uunXHE4kIW6uS4HWAXaOQ')

audio.getId()
// => {id: '5uunXHE4kIW6uS4HWAXaOQ', service: 'spotify' }
```

You can throw it a few types of url/strings:

```
'spotify:track:5uunXHE4kIW6uS4HWAXaOQ',
'https://open.spotify.com/track/5uunXHE4kIW6uS4HWAXaOQ',
'https://open.spotify.com/track/5uunXHE4kIW6uS4HWAXaOQ?si=6DD5tNAsRWieSursZHRm0A',
'<iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/5uunXHE4kIW6uS4HWAXaOQ" width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>',

```
