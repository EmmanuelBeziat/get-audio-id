# ðŸ”‰ get-audio-id
JS tool to parse music streaming services url to get a song ID.

> *Important Note:* This work is a fork-ish of [get-video-id](https://github.com/radiovisual/get-video-id) from [@radiovisual](https://github.com/radiovisual), but meant to use audio services (Spotify, Deezer, etc.). Credits for the work should go to him.

# Purpose

This module will extract the Spotify, Deezer, including embed strings.

> Wait, why would I want to do that?

Thatâ€™s a good question, thanks for asking.

Letâ€™s say you want your users to easily share their favorites songs. You can either share them a long list of tutorials to correctly embed players from multiple services, and hope that they donâ€™t mess up (they will). Or, you can just as them for any kind of url/share protocol from any service, and then just treat the data to render the correct player with the desired song.

Thatâ€™s what this little tool is used for.

# Install

```bash
$ npm install --save get-audio-id
```

# Usage

Just call the class with a spotify/deezer url (or embed string) as a parameter. Its metadata (id and service) will be extracted.

```javascript
import GetAudioId from 'get-audio-id'

const audio = new GetAudioId('spotify:track:2LfMWfjk9wIGv9sGTjhg85')

audio.getId()
// => {id: '2LfMWfjk9wIGv9sGTjhg85', service: 'spotify' }
```

You can throw it a few types of url/strings:

```javascript
const audio = new GetAudioId('https://open.spotify.com/track/2LfMWfjk9wIGv9sGTjhg85')
```

# Need more services?

If you need this tool to be enhanced with more string formats, more services, etc., you can either [open a Ticket](https://github.com/EmmanuelBeziat/get-audio-id/issues/new[) and ask me, or [submit a pull request](https://github.com/EmmanuelBeziat/get-audio-id/compare) of your work (just please follow the same coding guidelines).
